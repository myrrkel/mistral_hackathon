Hello! In this video, I will show you one of the many ways to use Mistral AI in Odoo and how to get better results with fine-tuning.

This project is mainly based on two Odoo addons I created:

AI Connector, To integrate AI into Odoo, and File2Record to upload any kind of file and create a new record from the extracted data.

A common use case is receiving a product data sheet in PDF format and then manually entering the data into Odoo.

Let's see how, by default and without any customization, we can import it automatically with the Mistral Large model.

Here is a complex product data sheet. We upload it from the product list view.

Now, we have a new product record. Let's check the product properties.
Mistral did part of the work: some fields are correctly set, but much of the information present in our file is missing.

Previously, the solution was to adapt the prompt until the result was right, but this was quite random.

This is a product manually updated.
The fields are the perfect transcription of the file.

By selecting "Add to AI training" a new Question/Answer record is created.
We can see the prompt we sent and the answer we expected.

These Question/Answers can be used to fine-tune a new model.

Select a tag to filter data and click on "Create Fine-Tuning Job"
Let's see the result of the last fine-tuning job I previously trained.
The job succeded, we can use this model to import new files.

We only need to set the new model in the "Default record creation" completion.

Let's try again to import our file. Of course, this file has not been used for the training.

Well, it seems to be perfect. All data is here! Mistral AI Fine-tuning works great!
